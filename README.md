# CapstoneDnD

This is a personal project I built for my capstone project in my final semester of study at University of Indianapolis. 

It is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition encounter randomizer, specifically for the earlier parts of the Lost Mines of Phandelver adventure. It takes inputs of player count and party level, and outputs an appropriate encounter for the party.

USAGE:

Input player, party count as integers. Click File > LmoP to generate.

#TODO
Make generation easier
Make better GUI
Add breadth and depth of monsters
Add support for additional campaign adventures.
